                    Humans are the most superior creatures amid all the creatures in the entire universe. <br>
                    Being a part of this universe makes me feel small and minuscule in a world where there millions of humans like myself.<br>
                     Although everyone is quite unique in their own way. I try my best to be humble, kind and respectful of everybody I meet regardless of their age, gender, family background, nationality or race.<br> 
                     It is not an easy task to write about oneâ€™s self because one may tend to either over exaggerate or fail to give succinct descriptions and commendations where necessary. <br>
                      It is with this background that I introduce myself.<br>
I am Yeboah Bridget. I am a Ghanaian. I live in Accra. I am nineteen years old.<br>
 I am the first of three children. Ours is a close knit family. <br>
 I have a younger brother and a younger brother as well. We are two girls in the family.<br> I love my siblings and my parents dearly and they love me too.<br>
I am currently in Level 200. I am a focus driven and hardworking which reflects in my grades. <br>
I currently study B.S.C. Information Technolgy at the University Of Ghana.I aspire to be a network administrator in 3 years to come .<br> 
I love to travel but i don't like tomeet new people. Its hard for me to make and keep  new friends because I'm used to being indoors. In short I'm not sociable but I'm working on that.<br>
I am an outgoing person and I love to have fun. My live centers on improving humanity and I love where I am at right now.<br><br><br>
